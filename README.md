# Open Source Astrology

## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY
In this project, we propose an artificial intelligence recommendation pipeline to recommend matches with potential collaborators, open source projects looking for contributors and public data to start anew. We divide this challenging problem into three subproblems, including (1) collecting, cleaning and standardizing information from users, projects and data banks, (2) find the most common patterns for matching between data endpoints, and (3) break the patterns and use unlikely astrology matches to pair nodes together. By partitioning the process into subproblems, each of them can be more representative, and can be further used in future customizable matching schemes. The results demonstrate that sometimes staying in your comfort zone or only exploring what you think you want is limiting, and you future might be in (or written by) the stars!

## PROJECT DETAILS
### INSPIRATION ‚ú®
The inspiration behind utilizing astrology as a paradigm for matching unlikely collaborators in open science projects stems from a profound recognition of the untapped potential that can emerge when we challenge conventional boundaries. Astrology, a centuries-old practice rooted in celestial alignments, offers a captivating metaphor for transcending the limitations of conventional thinking. By juxtaposing individuals and projects whose astrological profiles may not align conventionally, we introduce an element of serendipity and unpredictability into the collaborative process. This approach not only encourages diverse perspectives but also fosters creative synergy among collaborators who may otherwise remain undiscovered. In the realm of open science, where innovation and breakthroughs often emerge from unconventional connections and interdisciplinary collaborations, embracing astrology as a source of inspiration introduces an exciting avenue for harnessing the power of serendipity and unlocking new frontiers of discovery.

### WHAT IT DOES üíª
Introducing Open Science Astrology, a groundbreaking initiative poised to revolutionize collaborative efforts by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence. Our visionary project offers a meticulously designed recommendation pipeline that seamlessly connects individuals with compatible team members, aligns open source projects with enthusiastic contributors, and identifies relevant public datasets, all through the lens of astrology.

This transformative endeavor is structured around a three-fold approach:

Data Aggregation and Standardization: We meticulously gather, clean, and standardize information from diverse sources, including user profiles, project repositories, and data repositories. This meticulous data preparation forms the cornerstone of our recommendation system.
Pattern Recognition: Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we uncover prevailing patterns that underlie effective matches between disparate data sources. Our system identifies commonalities and connections that might elude conventional matchmaking algorithms.
Astrological Pairing: Going beyond conventional methodologies, Open Science Astrology employs astrological insights to create unique and unexpected pairings. By breaking free from conventional patterns and embracing unlikely astrological matches, we stimulate innovation and encourage novel collaborations.
By deconstructing this complex challenge into distinct subproblems, we not only enhance the representativeness of our recommendations but also lay the foundation for future customizable matchmaking solutions. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that remaining within your comfort zone or pursuing preconceived notions can be limiting. The future, as we reveal, might indeed be written in the stars.

Open Science Astrology is not just a project; it's a vision for a more interconnected, innovative, and harmonious future. Join us as we unlock the limitless potential of collaborative partnerships and data-driven discoveries, transcending traditional boundaries and expectations. The stars have aligned, and the possibilities are boundless.

### HOW WE BUILT IT üî®
Open Science Astrology's frontend is built using React and the backend is created using Node.js. Design and prototype were first created on pen and paper and then replicated in React.

The databases used is a team-complied database sourced from NASA Open Data Initiative Github and NASA's Open Data Portal as well as LinkedIn listings to create our matchings off of.

### CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO ‚ö†Ô∏è
As a team we have never used Chakra as a technology before. We also challenged ourselves to include an artistic aspect to utilize our team's full skill set to make a catchy jingle for our interface in hopes of attracting a larger userbase.

Additionally, reconciling the juxtaposition of astrology with scientific data presented a unique challenge. While astrology served as an inspirational metaphor for unconventional collaborations, bridging the gap between celestial interpretations and rigorous data science required careful consideration and fine-tuning. As a team it took a lot of deliberation to balance the appeal of astrological pairings and data-driven recommendations.

### ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'RE PROUD OF üèÜ
By successfully completing this project, we would take immense pride in ushering in a new era of collaborative innovation within the open science community. Open Science Astrology represents a pioneering effort to break free from conventional matchmaking paradigms and embrace the unexpected. We would be proud to have provided a platform that encourages diverse perspectives, fosters creative synergies, and unlocks the untapped potential hidden within the stars.

As aspiring professionals of visible minorities, we're proud to have created a useful website that signifies our commitment to bridging the gap between tradition and technology and lies in catalyzing breakthroughs and discoveries that emerge from these unconventional collaborations.

### WHAT WE LEARNED üè´
During the development of Open Science Astrology, we gained essential insights and lessons. In terms of soft skills we reaffirmed the significance of interdisciplinary thinking. Combining astrological inspiration with data science and artificial intelligence was an unconventional approach, but it taught us the power of merging diverse domains to foster creativity and uncover uncharted possibilities.

In terms of technological skills we learned:
- **data collection and management** by collecting, cleaning and standardizing data from diverse sources
- **machine learning techniques** looking for pattern recognition/node matching
- **cloud technologies** by deploying our project in the cloud environment

### WHAT'S NEXT FOR OPEN SCIENCE ASTROLOGYüí≠
The journey of Open Science Astrology continues to align with exciting possibilities. While astrology adds a cosmic touch, our real mission is to spark innovation by connecting diverse collaborators and projects. In the stars of our future, we see:

Refining Algorithms: We're fine-tuning our matchmaking algorithms to provide even more celestial connections.
User-Driven Enhancements: User feedback guides our journey, helping us customize and tailor recommendations.
Community Constellations: Building a vibrant community where researchers meet, collaborate, and reach for the stars.
Educational Stargazing: Illuminating educational paths for students and researchers to explore the cosmos of collaboration.
Scientific Validation: Collaborating with experts to validate our matchmaking magic (and how the stars hold the truth) and its impact on innovation.
